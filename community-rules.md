# Techlore Community Rules
***Spreading privacy & security to the masses***

We host several communities to offer a place for people to chat about privacy and learn from other community members. We believe in offering a tier-based system: from non-privacy services to heavily-privacy-respecting to cater to all possible audiences and give them a place to chat about privacy. Our goal is for members to start in community 1 and end up in community 3. To better accomodate this transition, we've bridged communities 1 & 3 so they can directly communicate with each other. Even if they decide not to switch, we are aware of varying threat models and are happy to accomodate community members of all levels.

## Rules
 
### 0
Every platform has its own guidelines you must follow. Ensure you are following the ToS for every platform you join.

### 1
**Create an environment where people aren’t afraid to speak and ask questions.** This means: No flaming, personal bashing, excessive trolling, out of control arguments, and similar behavior. If something gets out of hand, ping the mods and let them handle it. Don’t take moderation into your own hands.
 
### 2
**Everyone deserves equal treatment and equal respect. No gatekeeping!** Everyone is joining from different stages in their privacy journey, so instead of disrespecting others, share ideas and information with them to help them grow.
 
### 3
To incorporate all ages and demographics, **NSFW topics and content are strictly not allowed.** This includes – but is not limited to – videos or images depicting sexual actions, whether real or illustrated; verbal descriptions of  sexual acts; and any other discussions related to these topics.
 
### 4
**Discriminatory jokes and hate speech are not allowed.** Hate speech is an attack on an individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or disabilities.
 
### 5
**All illegal content is strictly prohibited.** This includes (but is not limited to) illegal licenses or key generators, ‘cracked’ software, illegal media content, personal threats, and other such topics and behavior. It is of the utmost importance that the security and privacy community is completely disassociated with illegal activities.

### 6
**Respect the moderators and all moderator decisions.** If you have an issue with a moderator decision, please reach out to Jonah or Henry in a direct message. Do not argue with the moderator either in chat or in direct messages, nor make any attempts to circumvent any actions they have taken. Not respecting this policy may result in an immediate ban.

### 7
**Community bans apply across all Techlore communities.** Do not attempt to circumvent bans on a platform like Discord or Telegram by joining other Techlore-operated platforms on Matrix, for example. Doing so may result in a permanent ban extension.

## Moderation Information

The moderation team is given a lot of flexibility in their role to make this server a great place for everybody, but typically we follow a three-warnings/mutes system before a server ban. It is at the discretion of the moderators to issue mutes, warnings, server kicks, and server bans; and they will do so based on the severity of whatever activity may have been performed.

Our excellent moderation team is charged with enforcing the rules above, but they are not the sole final arbiters of the policy. You may appeal or contest any moderation decision, but you must do so by sending a direct message to an administrator (Jonah or Henry) directly. Do not argue your case in public channels, do not direct message the moderator in question with your complaint, and do not attempt to circumvent any bans that may have been placed in order to do so.

All moderator-enacted server bans are considered “bans under review” and will be evaluated by an administrator later.

*Additionally, moderators making verbal abuse, insults, threats towards others, or displaying offensive, derogatory, or explicit content is strictly prohibited, and if you become aware of such behavior it should be reported to myself in a DM.*

## Additional Community Guidelines

These aren’t hard and fast rules, but general rules of thumb you should try and follow when you’re chatting here with us (especially or primarily in our on-topic chat rooms). We expect all our community members to act in good faith, and if you continually disregard our guidelines you may lose certain privileges such as the ability to chat in certain rooms.

### 1 
When you’re making any sort of claim contrary to popular opinion, belief, or guidance, it is your sole responsibility to provide valid evidence and sources to back up your claim. Don’t expect others to do all this research, and don’t continually argue or disagree if you are unwilling to do so.

### 2
Avoid discussing controversial or offensive topics. While occasionally warranted, oftentimes topics like politics or religion distract from our goals of education in the privacy and security space, and those topics may be better served elsewhere. Consider whether the discussion really fits the room topic, it may not be constructive in #chat, but may be well received in #politics, for example. More offensive topics including acts of violence, suicide/self-harm, or school shootings are always off-topic and should be avoided. Hate speech including racist, homophobic, sexist, or ableist slurs are always strictly prohibited pursuant to our rules above.
